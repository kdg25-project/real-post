This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Database Seeding

To populate the database with test data (company users and surveys):

1. Make sure the development server is running:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

2. In a separate terminal, install dependencies if you haven't already:

```bash
pnpm install
```

3. Run the seeder script:

```bash
pnpm seed
```

This will create 5 company users with complete profiles and 5 surveys for each company (25 surveys total).
